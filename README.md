This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in COBOL related to the FUNCTION LENGTH and data type handling.  The `bug.cob` file showcases the problematic code, where the length of a string, obtained using FUNCTION LENGTH, is stored into a numeric field with insufficient capacity. This can lead to unexpected results or program termination if the string exceeds the maximum value of the numeric field. The solution in `bugSolution.cob` addresses this by using a numeric field of appropriate size to handle the function's output.
